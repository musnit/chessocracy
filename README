Experimenting with on-chain chess that runs via state channels.

Teams play against eachother, each taking on different governance systems to play various governance systems off against eachother.

Project done with React/Truffle/Solidity

Chess contracts based off of https://github.com/ise-ethereum/on-chain-chess
